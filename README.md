# Gemini AI With Gemini-Vision 

Gemini AI with Gemini-Vision is a Python-based project that combines the power of AI-driven conversation (Gemini AI) with computer vision capabilities (Gemini-Vision) to deliver an interactive and versatile AI system.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the following:

1. `coregemini.py`: The core Python file implementing the Gemini AI and Gemini-Vision functionalities.
2. `api.txt`: A placeholder file for storing API keys required to access certain services (instructions on acquiring these keys are provided below).
3. `Images folder`: A folder to store images used in the Gemini-Vision module.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this project, you'll need:

1. Python [3.9 or higher]

### Installation

2. Go to the directory `cd gemini-ai`
3. Create a virtual environment.
4. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Obtaining API keys

You'll need to obtain API keys from Google (provide instructions or a link to the relevant documentation).

1. Go to `ai.google.dev` and Sing in with your Google Account. 
2. Get an API Key and place it into the `api.txt`

### Usage 

1. Run the project: `python coregemini.py`
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with Gemini AI and Gemini-Vision.

### Future Plans

I plan to enhance this project by building a web interface using Django. Contributions to improve the web interface or the codebase are appreciated!
